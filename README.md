## About IFlyrics

Final project for the Database discipline of the third period of the Internet Informatics course.

The project simulates a system of posting lyrics by fans.

## Challenge

The professor of the course made it a requirement of the activity not to use any ORM (in the case of Laravel, Eloquent). So the project does not use any migrations or models; the database is modeled using pure sql (`create.sql`) and uses the DB facade to execute queries in controllers.
